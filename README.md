# Team_PV
Test_repo Autumn school 2022
Learning goals:
-Apply what learned form prospective module (help Romain)
-Apply what we have learned from regionalization module (Chris)

Project goal: prospective assessment of future PV technologies 

Goal 1: Learn about premise

1. New inventory of PV technology 
2. Use the model of CH as reference 
2. Scenario file: what we want to change.


Goal 2: look new PV inventory in ecoinvent (BW2.5)
1. Import the new PV database or look into:
  - Aluminum, RER ---> dissagragate the market of electricity (
  - solar glass production, RER (Poland vs Norway)
  - Silicon ( not possible, it is part of the foreground system and it is hard to regionalize)
  
2. Import ecoinvent, call the activity Alumuniun ALMg3, RER, identify the market of electricy that we want to  (follow tuturial) 
   LCA and comparison of scenarios--> 
   How we export the new inventory? (CM)
