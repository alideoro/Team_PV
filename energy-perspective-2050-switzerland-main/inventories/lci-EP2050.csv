comment,"Dataset is modelled after Table 12.6 in (Jungbluth et al. 2012). Transport and emission of heat were excluded. The quantity of Silicon PV panel and mounting system were adjusted based on the present day power dentisty of Silicon PV. Both flows were parameterized to allow for analysis of future scenarios with increased power densities. Avoided burdens from recycling of the Silicon PV panel is included in the dataset for its production (see activity ""scSi_panel_RER"" in database ""Panels""). Avoided burdens from end-of-life (EoL) waste treatment of the Balance-of-System (BoS) were included here, because these were not included in the orginal datasets from ecoinvent. Recycleable materials are sent for treatment, with the recycling chain starting at the cut-off point for the recyclable material (i.e. the ""Recycled content, cut-off"" dataset of the respective material) and includes all processing steps up to the point of producing a material that can provide a like-for-like replacement with a virgin material in the technosphere. For more information, see the description of the datasets in the ""EoL"" database. From recycling of corrugated board box, two recycled products can be obtained: linerboard and fluting medium. For simplicity, a 50:50 ratio between both products is assumed here. This can be considered reasonable, since corrugated board box contains liner board and fluting medium at a ratio ranging from 60:40 to 40:60 and because of its overall minor contribution to the impacts from a demand for 1 unit of the product. Avoided burden from incineration of waste materials are included. - Jungbluth et al. 2012 Life Cycle Inventories of Photovoltaics - Version: 2012, https://esu-services.ch/fileadmin/download/publicLCI/jungbluth-2012-LCI-Photovoltaics.pdf [accessed  31-08-2022]",,,,,,,

comment,"Dataset is based on Table 28 of (Frischknecht et al. 2020). Names for inventory items listed by the original source are provided in the comments. Exact names of ecoinvent dataset for inventory items were not provided in the original source. Datasets from ecoinvent were therefore selected that provide a close as possible match to the name of the listed inventory item. Avoided burdens of electricity and heat from incineration of wastes are included in this dataset, using yields in MJ/kg waste incinerated, which were obtained from the ecoinvent dataset for treatment of the respective waste streams through incineration in Switzerland. Waste to be incinerated are: mixed plastic waste and spent solvent mixture. First generation recycling of the monofacial PSC-scSi tandem panel is modelled as recycling of scSi panel, without additional flows from the PSC-layer in the tandem. This result in an underestimation of emissions and avoided burdens from first generation recycling. Second geenration recycling does take into account the processing of the PSC-layer. Switching between recycling options is done in scenario analysis using a scenario file in which the flow to either first or second generation recycling is set to 0. When assesing this dataset in isolation, i.e. without scenario file, one should manually set the value for the flow of either first or second generation recycling to 0. - Frischknecht, R., Stolz, P., Krebs, L., de Wild-Scholten, M., & Sinha, P.
